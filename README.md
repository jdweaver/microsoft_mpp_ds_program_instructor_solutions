# microsoft_mpp_ds_program_instructor_solutions
Currently teaching a flipped-class version of the Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science. This repo contains my solutions for the Principles of Machine Learning lab and Capstone for the course ending on March 31. Note that the MPP program content is updated at least twice a year so the data sets and problems may be different in future iterations of the class.
